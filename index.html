		Hello World. I'm Ardy, an always analytical, brutishly benign, and casually creative data driven and ethical engineer who's focused, graceful, and a hacker at heart. I'm persistent, personable, passionate about problem solving, precise and pragmatic whilst programming. An expert in established technologies, I'm earnestly eager to experiment with emerging ensembles. My interests are broad and experience broader still, which have all contributed to make innate my foundational understanding of legacy through modern IT ecosystems and the infrastructure on which they are built. Abstract when architecting applications, data driven whilst balancing budgets, and creative whilst communicating, I can easily empathize with everyone or escape to an extended coding excursion in complete isolation. When necessary I'm a natural leader who loves to learn, takes time to teach, and can read between the lines to make sense of sibylline situations.
